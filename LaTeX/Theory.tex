\chapter{Agent Based Models of emergence of language variations: Theory and Simulation Results}
\label{ch:Theory}
Comment: Since we are interested in short time-scale changes, we stick to the term language variations instead of the term language evolution.
Language evolution is widely accepted as a summary of long time-range changes which introduce major changes in the quality of language - for instance by introducing a brand new way how to produce an utterance.
