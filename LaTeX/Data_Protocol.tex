\section{Data based protocol to verify the existence of the language microevolution of the individual speaker}

In this Section I propose a novel data based protocol to test the null hypothesis i.e. the existence of the language microevolution at the individual speaker level. I also suggest an extension of the protocol to measure the robustness or the fairness of the level of microevolution changes of the individual speaker language by running an additional evaluation using automatically generated voice with an aid of any text-to-speech device integrated into the pipeline.
